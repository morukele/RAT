R.A.T (Remote Access Tool) is a system that enables remote command execution on target systems. It allows operators to securely execute shell commands on remote computers, phones, or IoT devices.

## Features

- Remote shell command execution
- Agent auto-registration system
- Job queuing and management
- Real-time command output
- Cross-platform support
- Encrypted data exchange

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Agent**: The client-side software that:

   - Runs on the target system
   - Handles command execution
   - Manages system registration
   - Reports execution results

2. **Server** (Command & Control):

   - Manages agent connections
   - Handles job distribution
   - Stores execution results
   - Provides API endpoints

3. **Client CLI**:
   - User interface for operators
   - Agent management
   - Job creation and monitoring
   - Result retrieval

```

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (if running without Docker)
- Make

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rat.git
cd rat
```

2. Build all components:

```bash
make build
```

3. Start the server (with Docker):

```bash
make docker
make compose
```

Alternative server setup (without Docker):

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
# Configure environment variables (see Configuration section)
cargo run --release --bin server
```

4. Install the agent on target system:

```bash
cargo install --path agent
```

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

```bash
target/release/agent
```

### Client Commands

```bash
# List all registered agents
target/release/client agents

# View all jobs
target/release/client jobs

# Execute command on specific agent
target/release/client exec --agent <AGENT_ID> "<SHELL_COMMAND>"

# Get job result
target/release/client job <JOB_ID>
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SERVER_PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8080)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: info)

### Agent Configuration

The agent stores its configuration in:

- Unix: ~/.rat_agent_id
- Windows: %USERPROFILE%/.rat_agent_id

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent can't connect to server**

   - Check if server is running
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check firewall settings

2. **404 Not Found errors**

   - Ensure agent is properly registered
   - Verify agent ID is correct
   - Check API endpoint URLs

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check connection string
   - Ensure migrations are applied

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch

## Security

- All connections should be secured via HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authentication
- Use secure credential storage
- Regular security audits recommended
